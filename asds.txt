Recognizing the dire consequences, a coalition of 
the wisest beings from Lumos was formed. The enchanting
Elven folk with their ancient magic and the ingenious
humans and dwarfs with their advanced technology, 
gathered together in a celestial alliance. Faced with the 
cosmic inevitability, they embarked on a search for the solution
that will save them.

Pooling their mystical prowess and technological ingenuity,
the alliance managed to bring both planets to a miraculous
standstill. Lumos and Chronos hung suspended in the cosmic
void, frozen in time and space. A delicate equilibrium 
was achieved, preventing the catastrophic collision that
would have spelled certain annihilation.

Between the two worlds now lies the Celestial Nexus, 
a shimmering gateway that transcends the boundaries of
time and reality. Here, the essence of Lumos and Chronos
intertwines, creating a bridge between the realms. 
The Celestial Nexus became a hub of untold potential.

Yet, as the celestial energies mingled, 
unforeseen consequences began to unfurl. It wasn't 
long before the denizens of Chronos, including orcs,
trolls, dragons,... drawn by the allure of Lumos's
elated lands, started invading the realm. 
The once harmonious lands of 
Lumos became the battleground, with the vibrant landscapes 
now scarred by the ravages of war.

Now, Lumos and Chronos are locked in a perpetual struggle 
for dominance, with Lumos serving as the contested battleground. 
The luminous beauty of Lumos clashes with the relentless 
force of Chronos's armies, turning the once-thriving 
world into a war-torn realm. The Celestial Nexus, once 
a symbol of unity, now stands as a contested gateway 
between worlds, a testament to the enduring war that 
has raged ever since.
